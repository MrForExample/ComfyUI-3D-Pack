# ComfyUI-3D-Pack
**Make ComfyUI generates 3D assets as good & convenient as it generates image/video!**
<br>
This is an extensive node suite that enables ComfyUI to process 3D inputs (Mesh & UV Texture, etc.) using cutting edge algorithms (3DGS, NeRF, etc.) and models (InstantMesh, CRM, TripoSR, etc.)

## Install:
**Can be installed directly from [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)ðŸš€**

- [Pre-builds](https://github.com/MrForExample/Comfy3D_Pre_Builds) are available for:
  - Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 22.04
  - Python 3.10/3.11/3.12
  - CUDA 12.1/11.8
  - torch 2.3.0+cu121/cu118, torchvision 0.18.0+cu121/cu118
- [install.py](install.py) will download & install Pre-builds automatically according to your runtime environment, if it couldn't find corresponding Pre-builds, then [build script](_Pre_Builds/_Build_Scripts/auto_build_all.py) will start automatically, if automatic build doesn't work for you, then please check out [Semi-Automatic Build Guide](_Pre_Builds/README.md#build-required-packages-semi-automatically)
- If you have any missing node in any open Comfy3D workflow, try simply click [Install Missing Custom Nodes](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#support-of-missing-nodes-installation) in ComfyUI-Manager
- If for some reason your comfy3d can't download pre-trained models automatically, you can always download them manually and put them in to correct folder under [Checkpoints](Checkpoints) directory, but please **DON'T** overwrite any exist .json files
- **Note:** at this moment, you'll still need to install [Visual Studio Build Tools for windows](_Pre_Builds/README.md#build-for-windows) and [install `gcc g++` for Linux](_Pre_Builds/README.md#build-for-linux) in order for `InstantNGP & Convert 3DGS to Mesh with NeRF and Marching_Cubes` nodes to work, since those two nodes used JIT torch cpp extension that builds in runtime, but I plan to replace those nodes soon

## Features:
- For use cases please check out [Example Workflows](./_Example_Workflows/). [**Last update: 09/July/2024**]
  - **Note:** you need to put [Example Inputs Files & Folders](_Example_Workflows/_Example_Inputs_Files/) under ComfyUI Root Directory\ComfyUI\input folder before you can run the example workflow

- **Stack Orbit Camera Poses**: Automatically generate all range of camera pose combinations

  - Example usage:

    <img src="_Example_Workflows/_Example_Outputs/Cammy_Cam_Rotate_Clockwise_Camposes.png" width="256"/> <img src="_Example_Workflows/_Example_Outputs/Cammy_Cam_Rotate_Counter_Clockwise_Camposes.png" width="256"/>

  - Coordinate system:
    - Azimuth: In top view, from angle 0 rotate 360 degree with step -90 you get (0, -90, -180/180, 90, 0), in this case camera rotates clock-wise, vice versa.
    - Elevation: 0 when camera points horizontally forward, pointing down to the ground is negitive angle, vice versa.

- **FlexiCubes**: [nv-tlabs/FlexiCubes](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/FlexiCubes)
  - Multi-View depth & mask (optional normal maps) as inputs
  - Export to 3D Mesh
  - Usage guide: 
    - *voxel_grids_resolution*: determine mesh resolution/quality
    - *depth_min_distance* *depth_max_distance* : distance from object to camera, object parts in the render that is closer(futher) to camera than depth_min_distance(depth_max_distance) will be rendered with pure white(black) RGB value 1, 1, 1(0, 0, 0)
    - *mask_loss_weight*: Control the silhouette of reconstrocted 3D mesh
    - *depth_loss_weight*: Control the shape of reconstrocted 3D mesh, this loss will also affect the mesh deform detail on the surface, so results depends on quality of the depth map
    - *normal_loss_weight*: Optional. Use to refine the mesh deform detail on the surface
    - *sdf_regularizer_weight*: Helps to remove floaters in areas of the shape that are not supervised by the application objective, such as internal faces when using image supervision only
    - *remove_floaters_weight*: This can be increased if you observe artifacts in flat areas
    - *cube_stabilizer_weight*: This does not have a significant impact during the optimization of a single shape, however it helps to stabilizing training in somecases

## Tips
* OpenGL (Three.js, Blender) world & camera coordinate system:
  ```
      World            Camera        
    
      +y              up  target                                              
      |                |  /                                           
      |                | /                                           
      |______+x        |/______right                                      
      /                /         
     /                /          
    /                /           
  +z               forward           

  z-axis is pointing towards you and is coming out of the screen
  elevation: in (-90, 90), from +y to +x is (-90, 0)
  azimuth: in (-180, 180), from +z to +x is (0, 90)
  ```
* If you encounter OpenGL errors (e.g., `[F glutil.cpp:338] eglInitialize() failed`), then set `force_cuda_rasterize` to true on corresponding node
* If after the installation, your ComfyUI get stucked at starting or running, you could following the instruction in following link to solve the problem: [Code Hangs Indefinitely When Evaluating Neuron Models on GPU](https://github.com/lava-nc/lava-dl/discussions/211)
